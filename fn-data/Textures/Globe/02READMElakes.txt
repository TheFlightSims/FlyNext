The HydroLAKES database provides a seamless high-resolution map of the world’s
lakes and their main characteristics in support of a broad range of global-scale
assessments and analyses, with a focus on improving users’ ability to model the
important roles that lakes play in the global environment. The current version
contains the polygons for 1.5 million individual lakes.

HydroLAKES aims to be as comprehensive and consistent as possible at a global
scale and contains both freshwater and saline lakes, including the Caspian Sea,
as well as human-made reservoirs and regulated lakes. HydroLAKES achieves
virtually full completion for lakes above 35 ha in area and close to full
completion for lakes between 10 and 35 ha.
